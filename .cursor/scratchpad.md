# Farcaster Mini App: DeFi Position Tracker

## Background and Motivation
This project aims to build a Farcaster mini app that allows users to:
1. Sign in with Farcaster authentication
2. View all their DeFi positions on Base chain across all connected wallets
3. Receive notifications in Farcaster when concentrated volatile LP positions move out of range

The application will provide users with a convenient way to monitor their investments and receive timely alerts to take action when necessary, all within the Farcaster ecosystem.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Farcaster Authentication**: Implementing secure SIWF (Sign in with Farcaster) to obtain user credentials
   - ✅ Implemented the `sdk.actions.signIn()` method with proper nonce generation
   - ✅ Server-side verification of SIWF credentials
   - ✅ Neynar API integration for authentication and user data retrieval
   - ✅ Added developer testing mode for local development
   - ✅ Created standalone test page and API endpoints for testing without authentication

2. **Wallet Discovery**: Identifying all wallets connected to a user's Farcaster account
   - ✅ Using Neynar API to discover connected wallets for a Farcaster user
   - ✅ API endpoint created for fetching wallets with JWT authentication
   - ✅ Implemented mock wallets for testing

3. **DeFi Position Data**: Querying on-chain data to retrieve DeFi positions on Base chain
   - ✅ Integrated with Zapper Protocol API to fetch comprehensive DeFi positions
   - ✅ Focus on major DeFi protocols on Base: Uniswap V3 and Aerodrome (for concentrated liquidity positions)
   - ✅ API endpoint with caching to improve performance
   - ✅ Created test endpoints that return mock position data

4. **Position Monitoring**: Setting up a system to monitor concentration volatile LP positions
   - ✅ Background job system implemented using node-cron
   - ✅ Monitoring script for regular position checking
   - ✅ Status tracking to detect changes
   - ✅ Added test endpoint for monitoring simulation
   - ✅ Implemented WebSocket-based real-time monitoring system

5. **Notification System**: Implementing Farcaster notifications when positions go out of range
   - ✅ API endpoint for sending notifications
   - ✅ Mock notifications for testing
   - ✅ Integrated with real-time monitoring system

6. **Testing Infrastructure**: Creating a robust testing environment for Frame apps
   - ✅ Developer testing mode in the main app
   - ✅ Dedicated test page with debug information
   - ✅ Standalone API endpoints for testing core functionality
   - ✅ API status monitoring and debugging tools
   - ✅ Fixed image component configuration issues

7. **UI Design System**: Creating a consistent and appealing visual language for the app
   - ✅ Created design token definitions in TypeScript (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)
   - ✅ Implemented CSS variables for all design tokens
   - ✅ Created base component styles (buttons, cards, badges)
   - ✅ Implemented position card designs with status indicators
   - ✅ Added utility classes for layout, spacing, and typography

## Technical Architecture
1. **Frontend**: React-based Mini App using the Farcaster Frame SDK
2. **Backend**:
   - Node.js server for SIWF verification (using Neynar)
   - In-memory storage for caching and session management
   - WebSocket server for real-time position monitoring
   - Background jobs for position monitoring fallback
   - Will be deployed on Vercel for the main app and Digital Ocean for WebSocket server
3. **Data Sources**:
   - Neynar API for user authentication and wallet discovery
   - Zapper Protocol API for comprehensive DeFi position data
   - The Graph for real-time price monitoring via WebSockets
   - Protocol-specific APIs as fallback (Uniswap, Aerodrome)
4. **Notification System**:
   - Webhook integration with Farcaster for sending notifications
   - Position status tracking to avoid duplicate notifications
   - Real-time notification queue with retry mechanism
5. **Design System**:
   - TypeScript module with design tokens (src/styles/design-system.ts)
   - CSS variables for global styling (src/styles/variables.css)
   - Base component styles and utilities (src/styles/globals.css)

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

The DeFi Position Tracker application is now feature-complete with all major components implemented and tested. We've successfully implemented:

1. **Authentication System**: Full Farcaster authentication with both production and developer testing modes
2. **Position Tracking**: Complete integration with Zapper API for comprehensive DeFi position data
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**: WebSocket-based system for instant position status updates
4. **UI Design System**: Consistent visual design throughout the application

### Deployment Information
- **Production URL**: https://defi-tracker.vercel.app
- All app URLs and references have been updated to use this domain
- The WebSocket server will be deployed separately as Vercel doesn't support long-running WebSocket connections

### Real-Time Monitoring Implementation

After discovering that Vercel's cron jobs are unsuitable for real-time position monitoring (minimum interval is hourly), we've successfully implemented a WebSocket-based real-time monitoring system:

1. **WebSocket Server**: Created a dedicated server using socket.io with JWT authentication
2. **Price Monitoring**: Implemented real-time price tracking for Uniswap V3 pools using The Graph's WebSocket API
3. **Position Checking**: Added a position checker that continuously monitors position status against current prices
4. **Notification System**: Created a notification queue system that handles notifications with retry logic

The WebSocket server will be deployed separately from the main application, likely on Digital Ocean or AWS, as Vercel doesn't support long-running WebSocket connections.

### Next Steps
1. **Final Production Configuration**: Complete Vercel project settings and deploy the main application
2. **WebSocket Server Deployment**: Deploy the WebSocket server to an appropriate hosting service
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Perform end-to-end testing in a production-like environment
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for maintenance and future development

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

Questions:
1. Do we need additional environment variables for WebSocket server deployment?
2. Should we integrate any monitoring services for the WebSocket server (like DataDog, New Relic, etc.)?
3. Should we add usage metrics for better understanding of how users interact with the app?

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before you try to edit it
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- Vercel cron jobs aren't suitable for real-time monitoring; use a dedicated WebSocket server instead
- Proper authentication is crucial for WebSocket connections to prevent unauthorized access
- Testing real-time functionality requires specialized approaches like mock events and timeouts
